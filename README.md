This repository contains the course project for the CMU course "Machine Learning in Production / AI Engineering." 
## Project Title: Group Project - Movie Recommendations

## Project Overview:

This repository contains the course project for the CMU course "Machine Learning in Production / AI Engineering." The project involves implementing, evaluating, operating, monitoring, and evolving a recommendation service for a scenario of a movie streaming service. You will work with a dataset simulating a streaming service with about 1 million customers and 27,000 movies, aiming to build a recommendation system similar to those used by Netflix.

## Focus Areas:

Deployment and scaling of the recommendation service
Ensuring reliability and monitoring of the system
Handling drift and feedback loops to improve recommendations over time

## Infrastructure:

- Virtual Machine: Each team is provided with a virtual machine for development and deployment.
- Data Streams: Access to movie and user data via an API and server logs through an Apache Kafka stream.
- Prediction Service API: Teams will develop and deploy a recommendation service API accessible from the virtual machine.

## Provided Data:

Event Stream (Apache Kafka): Logs of user interactions, including movie watches and ratings.
APIs: Information about users and movies in JSON format.

## Documentation and Reports:
For each milestone, teams must document design decisions and implementation details. 

## Course Context:
This project is part of the coursework for the CMU "Machine Learning in Production / AI Engineering" course, designed to teach students how to build, deploy, and maintain ML-powered software products responsibly and reliably.
